  <h1>Introduction to Swami Vivekananda Scholarship (SVMCM)</h1>
  <p>
    The <strong>Swami Vivekananda Merit-cum-Means Scholarship (SVMCM)</strong> is one of the most impactful financial aid programs launched by the Government of West Bengal. 
    It aims to assist economically weaker yet meritorious students pursuing higher studies within the state. 
    The scholarship encourages young minds to continue education without financial stress, promoting academic excellence at every level — from higher secondary to postgraduate and professional courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thousands of students apply for this scheme every year through the official <a href="https://swamivivekanandascholarship.org/" target="_blank">Swami Vivekananda Scholarship portal</a>. 
    However, many applicants remain uncertain about whether they meet the eligibility criteria. 
    This detailed 2025 guide explains every academic, income, and institutional requirement for SVMCM so that students can apply with confidence.

    Below is a level-wise breakdown of eligibility requirements for each category.
  </p>

  <h3>1. Higher Secondary (HS) Level</h3>

  <h2>Income Criteria Explained</h2>
  <p>
    One of the key conditions under SVMCM is the <strong>family income cap of ₹2,50,000 per annum</strong>.  
    This limit ensures that the benefit reaches students from economically weaker backgrounds.  
    Applicants must upload a valid <strong>Income Certificate</strong> issued by one of the following:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>District Magistrate or Additional District Magistrate</li>
    <li>Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO)</li>
    <li>Block Development Officer (BDO)</li>
    <li>Revenue Officer (not below the rank of SI)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Certificates older than six months are not accepted.  
    Self-declared income affidavits without official signatures are also invalid.
  </p>

  <h2>Institutional and Course Requirements</h2>
  <p>
    Students must be enrolled in recognized educational institutions within the geographical limits of West Bengal.  
    Courses must be full-time and affiliated to approved boards or universities.  
    Distance or correspondence courses are not eligible under SVMCM, as the scholarship prioritizes regular attendance and academic engagement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Private institutions offering professional courses must have valid AICTE, NCTE, or MCI approval.  
    For universities, both state and central universities functioning in West Bengal are eligible.
